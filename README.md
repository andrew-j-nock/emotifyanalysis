# Emotify Analysis in R 

Is it possible to understand what type of music people will want to listen to and how it will make them feel? Data was collected on the reactions that different people have to different types of music using an application called 'Emotify'.

Emotify is a game that gives the subject a 60 second clip of a song from a genre chosen by the user. After listening to the song, the user describes their reaction to the song by selecting from a predefined list of possible perceived emotions. These 9 emotions were chosen by using the Geneva Emotional Music Scales (GEMS).

In this analysis I've included an overview of some different relationships among variables using ggplots and a 'final plots' section with some of the most interesting relationships.
